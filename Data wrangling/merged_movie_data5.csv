That case is the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto. In addition to seeing the extreme grief of the victim's husband Ricardo Morales, Benjamín, his assistant Pablo Sandoval, and newly hired department chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings were personally affected by the case as Benjamín and Pablo tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him. Despite the department already having two other suspects, Benjamín and Pablo ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gómez is the real killer. Although he is aware that historical accuracy is not paramount for the novel, the process of revisiting the case is more an issue of closure for him. He tries to speak to the key players in the case, most specifically Irene, who still works in the justice department and who he has always been attracted to but never pursued due to the differences in their ages and social classes. The other issue is that Gómez is still at large, no one aware if he is alive or dead. But as Pablo at the time mentioned that passion is one thing that cannot be changed in behavior, Benjamín learns now that that premise still holds true.",Spanish,"Argentina, Spain",Won 1 Oscar. 53 wins & 43 nominations total,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2FhZGI5M2QtZWFiZS00NjkwLWE4NWQtMzg3ZDZjNjdkYTJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '8.2/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '89%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '80/100'}]",80,8.2,"212,240",tt1305806,movie,21 Sep 2010,"$6,391,436",N/A,N/A,True,,

Riding Giants is a study in individuality and freedom, the pursuit and techniques of pure kinetic pleasure, and the risk taking and attitudes that characterize its leading figures. For some viewers, this is perhaps more than they ever wanted to know. But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle, its icons and locations, its boom and exploitation by the media, and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike. Closely chronicling the sometimes-life-and-death drama that big-wave riding entails, Riding Giants is an often-mesmerizing visual thrill ride. But the most appealing aspect of this often revelatory documentary is the realization that the man versus nature dialectic never ends; the search for the ultimate wave and the spiritual pinnacle can only be pursued but never reached.",English,"United States, France",1 win & 2 nominations,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFjOTcxMmQtNGYxMi00OWUxLThkNjYtMjg3NzU1YTUwNzM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzNzgxODE@._V1_SX300.jpg,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.8/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '93%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '80/100'}]",80,7.8,"4,569",tt0389326,movie,04 Jan 2005,"$2,276,368",Sony Pictures Classics,N/A,True,,

In the mirror he saw a 310lb man whose gut was bigger than a beach ball and a path laid out before him that wouldn't end well- with one foot already in the grave, the other wasn't far behind. FAT, SICK and NEARLY DEAD is an inspiring film that chronicles Joe's personal mission to regain his health. With doctors and conventional medicines unable to help long-term, Joe turns to the only option left, the body's ability to heal itself. He trades in the junk food and hits the road with juicer and generator in tow, vowing only to drink fresh fruit and vegetable juice for the next 60 days. Across 3,000 miles Joe has one goal in mind: To get off his pills and achieve a balanced lifestyle.

Some states have signaled progress. But amid the progress, The Mormon Church, with its front-group THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MARRIAGE, has been coordinating, financing and leading the effort to stop the advancement of marriage equality for more than three decades. As an organization worth hundreds of billions of dollars, the Mormon Church has been able to wage this war in secret. Not until the California Fair Political Practices Commission launched an investigation into the Mormon's involvement in Proposition 8, did the secrets of the Mormon effort become a matter of record. Through never-before seen documents, recordings &amp; insider-interviews, 8: THE MORMON PROPOSITION, exposes the efforts of the Mormon Church and its members to halt nearly every piece of LGBT legislation on the desks of lawmakers from Hawaii to New York. 8: THE MORMON PROPOSITION makes these efforts a matter of record and challenges viewers to demand more of government officials in requiring religions more transparency in their efforts to influence public policy.
